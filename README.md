# big-launcher

## What is this
Are you familiar with Mac OS X Launchpad? Or you know the Ubuntu one? 
This is a simple launcher project, for vue.js.
Rather than a real useful dashboard rather, this aims to be an exercise in style and, maybe, a proof of concept of Vue power.
I needed a launcher for some stuff, so I thought of making it decently customizable in style (padding, icon size, backgrounds and so on) and one day I will finish writing this readme.
